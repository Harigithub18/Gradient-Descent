# Gradient-Descent
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning and deep learning to minimize the error or cost function associated with a model. 
The fundamental idea behind gradient descent is to iteratively move towards the minimum of a function by adjusting the parameters of the model.
